## 🎯 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting and analyzing popular Iranian supermarket snacks and chips using advanced computer vision techniques. The system can:

- **Detect & Segment** 19 different Iranian snack products
- **Calculate Total Price** of detected items
- **Monitor Expiry Dates** and warn about products nearing expiration
- **Calculate Total Calories** for nutritional analysis
- **Process Videos** with real-time annotations
- **Generate Analytics** for retail inventory management

## Demo

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### 📅 Project Timeline & Date Sensitivity
- **Development Period**: This project was developed and tested over 3 months (July 2025 - October 2025)
- **Upload Date**: First uploaded to GitHub on October 6, 2025
- **Expiry Date Warning**: If you run the notebook today, the calculated expiry dates will differ from the demo results since the product data uses specific Persian calendar dates from the original development period
- **Date Dependencies**: The system calculates "days to expiry" based on the current date, so results will vary depending on when you run the analysis

### 💾 File Availability & GitHub Limitations
- **Original Platform**: Developed on Kaggle
- **GitHub Constraints**: The complete runs folder is too large for GitHub upload, so we only kept essential files:
  - ✅ Best model weights (needed for inference)
  - ✅ Key training results (performance metrics)
  - ✅ Sample outputs and predictions  
  - ❌ Complete training logs and checkpoints (too large for GitHub)
- **Note**: For full training reproduction, use Kaggle or Google Colab

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended for faster training/inference)
- FFmpeg (for video processing)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iranian-snack-detection.git
   cd iranian-snack-detection
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download pre-trained models:**
   - The YOLOv11 models will be automatically downloaded when first used
   - Or manually place your trained models in the `models/` folder

### Usage

#### 🔍 Image Detection

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load the trained model
model = YOLO('models/yolo11m-seg.pt')

# Run prediction on images
results = model.predict(
    source='path/to/your/images',
    save=True,
    conf=0.8
)
```

#### 🎥 Video Processing

```python
# Process video with annotations
results = model.predict(
    source='path/to/video.mp4',
    save=True,
    save_txt=True,
    conf=0.8
)
```

#### 📊 Run Complete Analysis

Open and run the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/iranian-snack-detection-yolo-eda.ipynb
